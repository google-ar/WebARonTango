/// @brief Configuration Parameters Get and Set Functions
///
/// For an allocated TangoConfig handle, these functions get and set parameters
/// of that TangoConfig handle. You can use the handle to query the current
/// state, or you can create a new handle and alter its contents to set the
/// service settings on TangoService_connect(). For each type of configuration
/// parameter (bool, double, string, etc) you call the corresponding get/set
/// function, such as TangoConfig_getBool() for a boolean.
///
/// The supported configuration parameters that can be set are:
///
/// <table>
/// <tr><td>int32 config_depth_mode</td><td>
///         Determines the depth data format provided from the API. See
///         @link TangoDepthMode @endlink for supported formats.</td></tr>
///
/// <tr><td>boolean config_enable_auto_recovery</td><td>
///         Automatically recovers when motion tracking becomes invalid, by
///         returning immediately to the initializing state in the pose
///         lifecycle. This will use the last valid pose as the starting pose
///         after recovery. If an area description is loaded, or if learning
///         mode is enabled, this will also automatically try to localize.
///         Defaults to true.</td></tr>
///
/// <tr><td>boolean config_enable_color_camera</td><td>
///         Enables the color camera if true. Defaults to false. Must be
///         set to true if connecting color camera or texture callbacks after
///         TangoService_connect() is called. When connecting a callback before
///         calling TangoService_connect() is called, config_enable_color_camera
///         is set to true internally. Due to potential lifecycle race
///         conditions it is recommended to always set to true if the color
///         camera is to be used.</td></tr>

/// <tr><td>boolean config_enable_depth</td><td>
///         Enables depth output if true. Defaults to false.</td></tr>
///
/// <tr><td>boolean config_enable_low_latency_imu_integration</td><td>
///         When the latest pose is requested or returned via callback, this
///         enables aggressive integration of the latest inertial measurements
///         to provide lower latency pose estimates, leaving the update
///         frequency unaffected. The accuracy may be slightly lower because
///         the inertial data is not yet integrated with a new visual feature
///         update.</td></tr>

///         This flag enables 100Hz pose updates in callback mode. If disabled,
///         pose updates are provided at 33Hz in callback mode. Default value is
///         true.</td></tr>
///
/// <tr><td>boolean config_smooth_pose</td><td>
///         This flag enables pose smoothing using a spatial smoothing method.
///         Small pose corrections are hidden while moving, large pose
///         corrections are applied instantly. Default value is true.</td></tr>
///
/// <tr><td>string config_load_area_description_UUID</td><td>
///         Loads the given Area Description with given UUID and attempts to

///         base frame AREA_DESCRIPTION and target frame DEVICE.
